## Installation

Install from drat with

```
# install.packages("drat") # -- if you don't have drat installed
drat:::add("ncov-ic")
install.packages("mcstate")
```

You will need a compiler to install dependencies for the package, and to build any models.  Use `pkgbuild::check_build_tools()` to see if your system is ok to use.

The development version of the package can be installed directly from GitHub if you prefer with:

```r
remotes::install_github("mrc-ide/mcstate", upgrade = FALSE)
```
