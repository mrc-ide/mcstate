adaptive_proposal_control(
  initial_scaling = 0.2,

  acceptance_target = 0.234,
  initial_weight = 1000,

}
\arguments{
\item{initial_scaling}{The initial scaling of the variance covariance matrix to be used to
generate the multivariate normal proposal for the random walk.}

\item{scaling_increment}{The scaling increment which is added or substracted to the scaling factor of
the variance-covariance after each adaptive step.}

\item{acceptance_target}{The target for the fraction of proposals that should be
accepted (optimally).}

\item{initial_weight}{Initial weight of the variance-covariance matrix used to build the
proposal of the random-walk. Higher values translate into higher confidence of the initial
variance-covariance matrix and means that update from additional samples will be slower.}

\item{adaptive_contribution}{The fractional contribution of the
adaptive part of the proposal}

\details{
Efficient exploration of the parameter space during an MCMC might be slow in higher dimension,
especially if the probability distribution explored present a high degree of correlation
between dimensions. Adaptive schemes are used to "learn" on the fly the correlation structure
by updating the proposal distribution by recalculating the empirical variance-covariance matrix
and rescale it at each step.

Our implementation of an adaptive MCMC algorithm is based on an adaptation of the "BlkAdpMul"
algorithm in Sherlock et al. (ALGORITHM 6). The algorithm is based on a random-walk
Metropolis-Hasting algorithm where the proposal is a multi-variate Normal distribution
centered on the current point.
