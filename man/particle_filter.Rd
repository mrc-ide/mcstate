\description{
Create a \code{particle_filter} object for running
and interacting with a particle filter.  A higher-level
interface will be implemented later.

# A basic SIR model included in the dust package

# Convert this into our required format:

data <- particle_filter_data(data_raw, "day", 4)

# A comparison function
compare <- function(state, observed, pars = NULL) {

\subsection{Method \code{new()}}{
Create the particle filter
\subsection{Usage}{

  data,

  n_particles,
  compare,
  index = NULL,

}

\subsection{Arguments}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="arguments">}}
\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{The data set to be used for the particle filter,
created by \code{\link[=particle_filter_data]{particle_filter_data()}}. This is essentially
a \code{\link[=data.frame]{data.frame()}} with at least columns \code{step_start}
and \code{step_end}, along with any additional data used in the
\code{compare} function, and additional information about how your
steps relate to time.}

\item{\code{model}}{A stochastic model to use.  Must be a
\code{dust_generator} object.}

\item{\code{n_particles}}{The number of particles to simulate}

\item{\code{compare}}{A comparison function.  Must take arguments
\code{state}, \code{observed} and \code{pars} as arguments (though the arguments
may have different names). \code{state} is the simulated model state
(a matrix with as many rows as there are state variables and as
many columns as there are particles, \code{data}
is a \code{list} of observed data corresponding to the current
time's row in the \code{data} object provided here in the
constructor.  \code{pars} is any additional parameters passed
through to the comparison function (via the \code{pars}
argument to \verb{$run}). Alternatively, \code{compare} can be \code{NULL}
if your model provides a built-in compile compare function
(if \code{model$public_methods$has_compare()} is \code{TRUE}), which may
be faster.}

\item{\code{index}}{An index function. This is used to compute the
"interesting" indexes of your model. It must be a function of
one argument, which will be the result of calling the
\verb{$info()} method on your model. It should return a list
with elements \code{run} (indices to return at the end of each
run, passed through to your compare function) and \code{state}
(indices to return if saving state). These indices can overlap
but do not have to. This argument is optional but using it will
likely speed up your simulation if you have more than a few
states as it will reduce the amount of memory copied back and
forth.}

\item{\code{initial}}{A function to generate initial conditions. If
given, then this function must accept 3 arguments: \code{info}
(the result of calling \verb{$info()} as for \code{index}),
\code{n_particles} (the number of particles that the particle
filter is using) and \code{pars} (parameters passed in in the
\verb{$run} method via the \code{pars} argument).  It
must return a list, which can have the elements \code{state}
(initial model state, passed to the particle filter - either a
vector or a matrix, and overriding the initial conditions
provided by your model) and \code{step} (the initial step,
overriding the first step of your data - this must occur within
your first epoch in your \code{data} provided to the
constructor, i.e., not less than the first element of
\code{step_start} and not more than \code{step_end}). Your function
can also return a vector or matrix of \code{state} and not alter
the starting step, which is equivalent to returning
\code{list(state = state, step = NULL)}.}

\item{\code{n_threads}}{Number of threads to use when running the
simulation. Defaults to 1, and should not be set higher than the
number of cores available to the machine.}

\item{\code{seed}}{Seed for the random number generator on initial
creation. Can be \code{NULL} (to initialise using R's random number
generator), a positive integer, or a raw vector - see \code{\link[dust:dust]{dust::dust}}
and \code{\link[dust:dust_rng]{dust::dust_rng}} for more details. Note that the random number
stream is unrelated from R's random number generator, except for
initialisation with \code{seed = NULL}.}

Run the particle filter
\subsection{Usage}{

}

\subsection{Arguments}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="arguments">}}
\describe{
\item{\code{pars}}{A list representing parameters. This will be passed as
the \code{pars} argument to your model, to your \code{compare}
function, and (if using) to your \code{initial} function. It must
be an R list (not vector or \code{NULL}) because that is what a
dust model currently requires on initialisation or \verb{$reset} - we
may relax this later. You may want to put your observation and
initial parameters under their own keys (e.g.,
\code{pars$initial$whatever}), but this is up to you. Extra keys
are silently ignored by dust models.}

\item{\code{save_history}}{Logical, indicating if the history of all
particles should be saved. If saving history, then it can be
queried later with the \verb{$history} method on the object.}

\item{\code{save_restart}}{An integer vector of time points to save
restart infomation for. These are in terms of your underlying time
variable (the \code{time} column in \code{\link[=particle_filter_data]{particle_filter_data()}}) not in
terms of steps. The state will be saved after the particle
filtering operation (i.e., at the end of the step).}

\subsection{Method \code{run_begin()}}{
Begin a particle filter run. This is part of the
"advanced" interface for the particle filter; typically you will
want to use \verb{$run()} which provides a user-facing wrapper around
this function. Once created with \verb{$run_begin()}, you should take
as many steps as needed with \verb{$step()}.

\subsection{Method \code{state()}}{
Extract the current model state, optionally filtering.
If the model has not yet been run, then this method will throw an
error. Returns a matrix with the number of rows being the number of
model states, and the number of columns being the number of
particles.

\if{html}{\out{<a id="method-history"></a>}}
\if{latex}{\out{\hypertarget{method-history}{}}}
\subsection{Method \code{history()}}{
Extract the particle trajectories. Requires that
the model was run with \code{save_history = TRUE}, which does
incur a performance cost. This method will throw an error if
the model has not run, or was run without \code{save_history = TRUE}. Returns a 3d array with dimensions corresponding to (1)
model state, filtered by \code{index$run} if provided, (2)
particle (following \code{index_particle} if provided), (3)
time point. If nested parameters used then returns a 4d array with
dimensions corresponding to (1) model state, (2) particle, (3)
population, (4) time point.

\subsection{Arguments}{
\if{html}{\out{<div class="arguments">}}
\describe{
\item{\code{index_particle}}{Optional vector of particle indices to return.
If nested parameters used then a vector will be replicated to a matrix
with number of columns equal to number of populations, otherwise a
matrix can be supplied.
If \code{NULL} we return all particles' histories.}

\subsection{Method \code{restart_state()}}{
Return the full particle filter state at points back in time
that were saved with the \code{save_restart} argument to
\verb{$run()}. If available, this will return a 3d array, with
dimensions representing (1) particle state, (2) particle index,
(3) time point. If nested parameters are used then returns a 4d array,
with dimensions representing (1) particle state, (2) particle index,
(3) population, (4) time point. This could be quite large, especially
if you are using the \code{index} argument to create the particle filter
and return a subset of all state generally. It is also
different to the saved trajectories returned by \verb{$history()}
because earlier saved state is not filtered by later filtering
(in the history we return the tree of history representing the
histories of the \emph{final} particles, here we are returning all
particles at the requested point, regardless if they appear in
the set of particles that make it to the end of the
simulation).

Return a list of inputs used to configure the particle
filter. These correspond directly to the argument names for the
particle filter constructor and are the same as the input
argument with the exception of \code{seed}, which is the state of
the rng if it has been used (this can be used as a seed to
restart the model).

model) after creation. This can be used to allocate additional
(or subtract excess) computing power from a particle filter.
